# Bootcamp-challenge

In this weeks challenge, i was asked to create a portfolio, in the form of a website. I will be able to add to this as i go on through the course.

## HTML
I started by creating my HTML file. I ensured that the HTML was semantic by avoiding <em>div</em> elements and making use of semantic elements such as <em>article</em>, <em>main</em> etc and also using ARIA labels and alt attributes for images. Ensuring that those who use assistive technology would also be able to navigate the website.
I started off, by having my navigation bar at the top of the page. Below this was an emoji of me and a small paragraph introducing me. I then had a screenshot of my first project, which was the horiseon project. This project involved me refractoring code. I then added an article with 6 sections. I used this sections as placeholders for future projects. I added a link to the text, which currently goes to google, however in future it will link to my projects.

## CSS
 In the CSS i styled my website to my liking.I began by using the universal selector to set the margin, padding etc to 0. Then I placed the navigation bar at the top of the page. I made the navigation links central and i used CSS styling to make them capital and remove the underline. I then used CSS pseudoselectors to style the links, so that they change colour, when clicked, hovered over and when visited.
 
I ensured that the website had the display function flex, and felx-wrap throughout, to ensure that when the page is smaller, the items adjust accordingly.
In the footer section, i made used of the href:mailto function within the <em>a</em> element. 
 
## Below are screenshots of my website:
